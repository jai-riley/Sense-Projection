d001.s005	What is Alimta ?
d001.s006	Alimta is a powder that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
d001.s007	It contains the active substance pemetrexed .
d001.s008	What is Alimta used for ?
d001.s009	Alimta is used to treat two types of cancer : pleural mesothelioma ( cancer of the lining of the lungs that is usually caused by exposure to asbestos ) .
d001.s010	Alimta is used together with cisplatin ( another anticancer medicine ) when the cancer is unresectable ( cannot be removed by surgery alone ) and malignant ( has spread , or is likely to spread easily , to other parts of the body ) , in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) before advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that is not affecting the squamous cells .
d001.s011	Alimta is used in combination with cisplatin in patients who have not been treated before , and on its own in patients who have received another type of chemotherapy in the past .
d001.s012	The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
d001.s013	How is Alimta used ?
d001.s014	Alimta should only be given under the supervision of a doctor who is qualified in the use of anticancer chemotherapy .
d001.s015	The recommended dose of Alimta is 500 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculated using the patient s height and weight ) . It is given once every three weeks as an intravenous infusion lasting 10 minutes .
d001.s016	To reduce side effects , patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid ( a type of vitamin ) , and receive injections of vitamin B12 during treatment with Alimta .
d001.s017	When Alimta is given with cisplatin , an anti-emetic medicine ( to prevent vomiting ) and fluids ( to prevent dehydration ) should also be given before or after the cisplatin dose .
d001.s018	Treatment should be delayed or discontinued , or the dose reduced , in patients whose blood counts are abnormal or who have certain other side effects .
d001.s019	Alimta is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe kidney problems .
d001.s020	For more information , see the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) .
d001.s021	How does Alimta work ?
d001.s022	The active substance in Alimta , pemetrexed , is a cytotoxic medicine ( a medicine that kills cells that are dividing , such as cancer cells ) , which belongs to the group antimetabolites .
d001.s023	In the body , pemetrexed is converted into an active form that blocks the activity of the enzymes that are involved in producing nucleotides ( the building blocks of DNA and RNA , the genetic material of cells ) .
d001.s024	How has Alimta been studied ?
d001.s025	For the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma , Alimta has been studied in one main study in 456 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease before .
d001.s026	The effects of Alimta in combination with cisplatin were compared with those of cisplatin alone .
d001.s027	For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer , the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel ( another anticancer medicine ) in one study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past .
d001.s028	Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine ( another anticancer medicine ) , both in combination with cisplatin , in a study involving 1,725 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer in the past .
d001.s029	In all three studies , the main measure of effectiveness was how long the patients survived .
d001.s030	What benefit has Alimta shown during the studies ?
d001.s031	Alimta increased the survival time of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma .
d001.s032	Patients receiving Alimta and cisplatin survived for an average of 12.1 months , compared with 9.3 months in those receiving cisplatin alone .
d001.s033	In the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer , Alimta was as effective as the comparators .
d001.s034	In patients who had received chemotherapy in the past , the average survival time was 8.3 months with Alimta , compared with 7.9 months with docetaxel .
d001.s035	In patients who had not received chemotherapy in the past , the average survival time was 10.3 months in both groups .
d001.s036	However , in both studies , patients whose cancer was not affecting squamous cells had longer survival times if they received Alimta than if they received the comparator .
d001.s037	In contrast , patients whose cancer was affecting squamous cells had shorter survival times if they received Alimta . kalgebra is a mathematical calculator based on content markup MathML language .
d001.s038	Nowadays it is capable to make simple MathML operations ( arithmetic and logical ) and to representate 2D and 3D graphs .
d001.s039	It is actually not necessary to know MathML to use kalgebra . kalgebra is a MathML based graph calculator .
d001.s040	Although it was initially MathML oriented it can now be used by everyone with little mathematical knowledge .
d001.s041	Here 's a screenshot of kalgebra main window kalgebra main window kalgebra main window consists in a Console tab , a 2D Graph tab , a 3D Graph tab and a Dictionary tab .
d001.s042	Below these tabs you will find an input field to type your functions or do your calculations .
d001.s043	If we want to understand how it works , the best thing we can do is to realize that our input is being converted into MathML although it is not necessary to know MathML .
d001.s044	I have based the syntax basically on common sense , it should not be hard for anyone .
d001.s045	I ve looked closely to maxima and maple s syntax so they look very similar . + - * / : Addition , subtraction , multiplication and division . ^ , ** : Power , you can use them both .
d001.s046	Also it is possible to use the unicode Â² characters .
d001.s047	Powers are one way to make roots too . -gt : It s the way to specify the bounded variable in a function . ( ) : It is used to specify a higher priority . abc(params) : When the parser finds a function , it checks if abc is an operator .
d001.s048	If it is , it will be treated as an operator , if it is not , it will be treated as a user function . : = : It is used to define a variable value . ? : Piecewise condition definition .
d001.s049	Piecewise is the way we can define conditional operations in kalgebra .
d001.s050	If we introduce the condition before the ? it will use this condition only if it is true , if it finds a ? without any condition , it will enter in the last instance . { } : MathML container . It can be used to define a container .
d001.s051	Mainly useful for working with piecewise .
d001.s052	Now you could ask me , why should the user mind about MathML ? That s easy . With this , we can operate with functions like cos() , sin() , any other trigonometric functions , sum() or product() .
d001.s053	It does not matter what kind it is .
d001.s054	We can use plus() , times() and everything which has its operator . kalgebra 's console is useful as a calculator .
d001.s055	There you have a list of the declared variables .
d001.s056	By double clicking on them you will see a dialog that lets you change their values ( just a way to trick the log ) .
d001.s057	Every time you enter an expression , the " ans " variable value will be changed to the last result .
d001.s058	Ctrl N New Window
d001.s059	Flushes the log .
d001.s060	Ctrl L Load Script
d001.s061	Executes the instructions in a file sequentially .
d001.s062	Nice if you want to define some libraries or resume some previous work .
d001.s063	Ctrl G Save Script
d001.s064	Saves the instructions you have typed since the session began to be able to reuse .
d001.s065	Generates text files so it should be easy to fix using any text editor , like Kate .
d001.s066	Ctrl S Save Log
d001.s067	Saves the log with all results into an HTML file to be able to print or publish .
d001.s068	Ctrl Q Quit
d001.s069	Shuts the program down .
d001.s070	To add a new 2D graph on kalgebra , what you have to do is to go to the 2D Graph tab and click in the Add tab to add the new function .
d001.s071	Then your focus will go to an input text box where you can type your function .
d001.s072	If you want to use a typical f(x) function it is not necessary to specify it .
d001.s073	If you have entered the function click on the OK button to display the graph in the main window .
d001.s074	You can set several graphs on the same view .
d001.s075	Just use the Add button when you are in List mode .
d001.s076	You can set each graph its own color .
d001.s077	The Foundation has recently been involved in organising a conference which dealt with this critical challenge .
d001.s078	Over 100 participants from the main interest groups attended and debated issues such as the role of key actors including public authorities , social partners , voluntary and community organisations as well as service users .
d001.s079	There were relatively few cases reported of attempts to involve users in service planning but their involvement in service provision was found to be more common .
d001.s080	Note was also taken of the variety of different roles played by public welfare
d001.s081	The Foundation organised , together with the European Commission , the Spanish Ministry of Social Affairs and the Galician regional government , a European conference on social exclusion : a major challenge for public welfare services .
d001.s082	The Foundation recently published a comparative study as part of the EPOC project which assesses the extent to which direct participation can humanise work while increasing profitability .
d001.s083	The study is based on 195 personal interviews with senior officials of the social partners as representatives of national level peak organisations in fifteen European countries .
d001.s084	As important industrial sectors , the metal industry and the banking sector were also included .
d001.s085	Key speakers at the social exclusion conference were ( left to right ) Cristina Louro , Employment , Industrial Relations and Social Affairs Directorate , European Commission Fernando Gomes , a high degree of Committee of the Regions Barbara Weiler , Member of the European Parliament JosÃ© Maria Gil-Robles , Vice-President , European Parliament and John Carroll , Economic and Social Committee .
d001.s086	Case Studies Each national report contains a portfolio of between 25 and 30 initiatives which best present policies and practices to improve the recruitment , training and development of ageing workers in both the work place and the community .
d001.s087	For each country , two or three initiatives have been selected for further in depth case study .
d001.s088	These case studies analysed the background of the initiatives , their impact on employment patterns and work organisations and assessed the benefits and problems of the initiative .
d001.s089	Visits and interviews with key personnel were also undertaken .
d001.s090	These national studies will form the basis of a European report which synthesises overall practices .
d001.s091	The report and a case book of initiatives will be published in 1996 and provide the backdrop for a conference to be staged in Autumn , 1996 .
d001.s092	The Foundation aims to document the characteristics of age barriers in job recruitment and training and to analyse their causes .
d001.s093	The perspectives of the social partners is also being examined , with particular attention paid to proposals for removing age barriers .
d001.s094	Thirdly , the project documents and assesses initiatives , in both the public and private sectors which combat age barriers , especially for older workers .
d001.s095	Seeking alternatives to early retirement and redundancy , the project is primarily concerned with the retention , reintegration and retraining of older workers .
d001.s096	The gender and ethnic backgrounds of workers and how these relate to age discrimination are examined .
d001.s097	The project also considers initiatives to combat age discrimination in rural areas and in small and medium sized enterprises .
d001.s098	Seven member states are covered by the project : Belgium , France , Germany , Greece , Italy , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom .
d001.s099	This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
d001.s100	What is Cerenia ?
d001.s101	Cerenia contains the active substance maropitant and is available as tablet or as solution for injection .
d001.s102	The tablets are pale-orange and have a score line on both sides so that they can be halved .
d001.s103	Each tablet is marked with the Pfizer logo on one side and with the letters MPT and the quantity of maropitant on the other side .
d001.s104	What is Cerenia used for ?
d001.s105	Cerenia is an anti-emetic , this means that it stops vomiting .
d001.s106	It is used in dogs to prevent vomiting such as vomiting caused by chemotherapy ( medicines used for the treatment of cancer , some of which are known to cause vomiting ) .
d001.s107	In combination with supportive measures such as other veterinary treatment or a special diet , Cerenia can also be used in the treatment of vomiting ( either as injection or as injection followed by tablets ) .
d001.s108	For these purposes , Cerenia can be given for up to five days
d001.s109	How does Cerenia work ?
d001.s110	Cerenia blocks a neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptor , which acts in the central nervous system .
d001.s111	How has Cerenia been studied ?
d001.s112	A large number of studies with Cerenia were carried out either in laboratory dogs or in animal patients at veterinary practises in several European countries and in the USA .
d001.s113	What benefit has Cerenia shown during the studies ?
d001.s114	The results of the studies showed that Cerenia was more effective than the placebo : less vomiting was seen in dogs that received the medicine than in dogs that received a placebo , both in the treatment or in the prevention of vomiting .
d001.s115	The treatment of a vomiting dog should be started with the injection , since vomiting animals might not be able to keep a tablet down ( as they might throw the intact tablet up again ) .
d001.s116	For follow-up treatment , the animal owner can administer the tablets to the dog .
d001.s117	Also , the treatment of vomiting should only be together with other supportive measure or other veterinary therapy while addressing the underlying causes of the vomiting .
d001.s118	What is the risk associated with Cerenia ?
d001.s119	Cerenia was generally well tolerated when administered daily at dosages up to 5 times the recommended doses for an extended period of time ( up to 3 times the recommended maximum duration of treatment ) .
d001.s120	What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
d001.s121	Cerenia does not represent a particular risk for people .
