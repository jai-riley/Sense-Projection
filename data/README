The dataset provided for Farsi, Bengali, and Chinese follow the format that each token, regardless of if it has been assigned a sense is given a token ID.

The datasets provided for Spanish and Italian follow the format where only the tokens that are given a sense, are also given a token ID. 

The English data is provided in both of these formats as to allow for both to be test. 
The files in the English/Original directory match the format of the Bengali, Farsi, and Chinese data.
